# Diner Master - Food & Recipe Delivery App (UI Design Project)

**Link to Live Prototype:** https://erilaxh.github.io/DinerMaster-Axure-Prototype/

## Introduction

This project, completed for **COMP 1773 User Interface Design** at **SEGI College, Penang** (under the **University of Greenwich** program), presents "Diner Master" â€“ a mobile application designed for a new food and recipe box delivery company. The company uniquely focuses on **one-person households** and utilizes **locally produced goods** to offer a variety of **healthful recipes**. Diner Master serves as a dual-purpose app, functioning as both a food delivery platform and a recipe viewing guide, designed to cater specifically to these user needs.

## Problem & Solution

The project addresses the need for a convenient and healthy meal solution for individuals with busy schedules or those seeking to easily access and prepare recipes using locally sourced ingredients. "Diner Master" aims to simplify the dining experience by providing:
* Pre-prepared meal options for quick consumption.
* Detailed recipes with shopping lists for home cooking.
* A focus on single-serving meals and healthy, locally-sourced ingredients.

## User Research & Personas

To understand the target audience, two primary user personas were developed:

* **Emily, the Busy Professional (25-35, Female, Single):**
    * **Motivations:** Desires quick, healthy, and locally-sourced meals; values convenience and efficiency.
    * **Pains:** Lack of time to cook elaborate meals, limited dining options for solo diners.
    * **Goals:** Simplify dining, enjoy delicious meals without cooking hassle.

* **Noah, the Cooking Enthusiast (35, Male, Married with two children):**
    * **Motivations:** Enjoys experimenting with new recipes, wants to provide healthy, locally-sourced meals for family/guests.
    * **Pains:** Difficulty finding new recipes, limited availability of local ingredients, customizing recipes for dietary restrictions.
    * **Goals:** Improve cooking skills, discover new recipes, create memorable dining experiences.

## Visual Design Choices

* **Application Model:** Designed as a **Hybrid or Progressive Web App** for flexibility and broad accessibility across Android, iOS, and web platforms, maximizing audience reach.
* **Color Scheme:** Utilizes a **Dark Theme** (primary colors: black `#000000`, white `#FFFFFF`, cyan `#80FFFF`) to reduce eye strain, especially during night-time use.
* **Font Style:** **Arial**, a Sans Serif font, is chosen for its clarity and readability.
* **Graphic Elements:** Heavy use of familiar icons to represent functions and actions. The brand logo doubles as a home button, and images are used to depict food and recipes prominently.

## Prototype Evaluation & Design Iteration

The project involved developing low-fidelity prototypes (Design A and Design B) and evaluating them against **Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design**.

**Key Findings & Improvements from Low-Fidelity Evaluation:**

* **Design A:** Showed straightforward navigation. Recommendations included adding prominent loading indicators, enhancing error recovery, implementing a confirmation button, and including a user guide.
* **Design B:** Maintained consistency and standards with a filter bar. Key issues were the lack of a search box on the main page and vertical listing of categories. Recommendations focused on incorporating a search box and changing category listings to horizontal for better access.

The **Mid-Fidelity Prototype** combined the strengths of both designs, integrating Design A's easy navigation with Design B's helpful features, while addressing all identified shortcomings.

## Final Mid-Fidelity Prototype Features

The final prototype showcases core functionalities in both **portrait** and **landscape** orientations:

* **Login Page:** Secure login with password visibility toggle and sign-up option.
* **Main/Home Page:** Displays recommended and most popular food/recipes, search bar, and promotional advertisement slides. Logo acts as a home button.
* **Selection Page:** Allows users to browse food and recipe categories with a food/recipe toggle. Includes star ratings for food and bookmark counts for recipes. Landscape mode features a filter sidebar for refined searches.
* **Filter Page:** Provides detailed filtering options by cuisine and category (e.g., Vegan, Vegetarian) with a confirmation button.
* **Food Details Page:** Shows detailed food information, allows customization (doneness, sauce, notes), adding to cart, and user comments. Includes a back button for navigation.
* **Recipe Details Page:** Displays detailed recipe information, features a "Cook Mode" toggle to prevent screen sleep, allows saving/favoriting recipes, and viewing/adding comments.
* **Saved Recipes Page:** Accessible via the cookbook icon, displaying all saved recipes. Includes pagination and a filter sidebar in landscape mode.
* **Cart Page:** Users can review items, delivery address, and payment method before confirming their order. Accessible via the cart icon and includes a back button.

## Critical Reflection & Learnings

Through this assignment, I gained significant knowledge in various aspects of UI design, including:
* Considerations for different mobile operating systems (iOS and Android).
* The impact of color themes (light and dark) on user experience.
* Understanding different mobile app types (native, web, progressive web, and hybrid apps).
* The process of creating user personas and scenarios to identify target users.
* Evaluating low-fidelity prototypes using Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics.
* Utilizing Axure RP 10 for mid-fidelity design and interactive prototyping, including Dynamic Panels and Interaction functions.

I also reflected on personal challenges, particularly in time management, and plan to improve through better planning and consistent task completion in future projects.

## Future Enhancements

Proposed enhancements for future iterations of Diner Master include:
* Adding a function to allow user to add cooking videos to their respective recipe page, with a step-by-step auto pause time slice to the video during "Cook Mode".
* Implementing more error messages and confirmation steps to enhance error avoidance and increase security of the system via validation of passwords.

## My Role

**Sole UI/UX Designer & Prototyper:** I independently conceived, researched, designed, and developed this interactive prototype. My responsibilities included:
* Defining user needs and problem statements based on provided project requirements.
* Conducting background research on mobile platforms, app types, and design themes.
* Developing user personas and scenarios to inform design decisions.
* Creating low-fidelity wireframes (Design A and B) and evaluating them using Nielsen's Usability Heuristics.
* Iterating on designs to produce a mid-fidelity prototype in Axure RP 10.
* Designing the user interface for both portrait and landscape orientations, focusing on usability, visual hierarchy, and intuitive interactions.
