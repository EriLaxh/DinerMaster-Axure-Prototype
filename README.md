## Introduction

Diner Master is a comprehensive interactive prototype designed to simulate an all-in-one platform for food, recipe management, and delivery services. Developed with a focus on intuitive user experience and robust functionality, this prototype explores solutions for streamlining restaurant operations and customer interactions.

## Features

* **Comprehensive Food Platform:** Integrates functionalities for ordering food, Browse recipes, and managing delivery logistics within a single application.
* **Interactive User Flows:** Demonstrates key user journeys for customers (ordering, tracking) and potential restaurant staff (order management, menu updates).
* **Adaptive Layouts:** Designed to support both portrait and landscape orientations, ensuring an optimal viewing and interaction experience across different devices.
* **Intuitive UI/UX:** Focuses on clear navigation, logical information architecture, and user-friendly interface elements.

## Key Technologies

* **Axure RP 11:** Utilized for high-fidelity prototyping, interactive wireframing, and generating the dynamic HTML/CSS/JS output.
* **UI/UX Design Principles:** Applied best practices for user-centered design, information architecture, and interaction design.

## My Role

**Sole Designer & Prototyper:** I conceived, designed, and meticulously prototyped every aspect of the Diner Master application. My responsibilities included:

* **Concept & Strategy:** Defining the app's core purpose, target users, and key functionalities (food ordering, recipe Browse, delivery).
* **User Experience (UX) Design:** Conducting hypothetical user flows, creating information architecture, and mapping out user journeys.
* **User Interface (UI) Design:** Crafting the visual layout, interactive elements, typography, and color schemes.
* **Interactive Prototyping:** Building high-fidelity, clickable prototypes in Axure RP 11 to demonstrate functionality and user interactions, including adaptive layouts for portrait and landscape.
* **Feature Implementation:** Integrating specific features such as search, filtering, order processing, and navigation logic within the prototype.
